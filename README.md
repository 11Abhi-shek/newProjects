# newProjects/Conatct_Page
The goal of this project is to create a contact page for a website where users can submit their information or inquiries. A contact page is an essential element for websites, allowing visitors to get in touch with the site's owners, support team, or administrators easily. The page will include a form that users can fill out to provide their contact details and messages.
